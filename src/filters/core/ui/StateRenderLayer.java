/**
 * This class provides 2D visualization of states by being provided a set of
 * classes that can paint ObjectInstnaces to the canvas as well as classes that
 * can paint general domain information. Painters for object classes as well as
 * specific object instances can be provided. If there is a painter for an
 * object class and a painter for a specific object instance of that same class,
 * then the specific object instance painter will be used to pain that object
 * instead of the painter for that instnace's OO-MDP class.
 * <p>
 * The order of painting is first the static painters, in the order they were
 * added; then the object class painters in the order they were painted (except
 * for objects that have specific object painter); finally, the object instances
 * that have specific painter associated with them, in the order that they
 * appear in the state object list.
